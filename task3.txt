The difference between Document and Window object

The document and window object are the object whose interfaces you generally use most often in DOM 
programming. In simple terms, the window object represents like the browser and the document object is the
root of the document itself. Elememt inherits from the generic node interface and together these two 
interfaces provide many of the methods and properties use on individual element.

Window objects:
The window object is a global object i client side javascript, representing the browser window containing a
DOM document andd acting as the root of the document object model. The window object supporting by all browser
and represent the browser's window and automatically includes global javascript objects, functions and 
variables as member. The window object is responsible for managing the global variables, functions and objects
providing methods for browser interaction and managing properties related to frames, tabs, windows such as 
alert(), confirm(), setTimeout() and setInterval().

Few Properties of Window objects are,

window.innerHeight - the inner height of the browser window(in pixels)
window.innerWidth - the inner width of the browser window(in pixels)

Few Methhodds of Window objects are,

window.open() - open a new window
window.close() - close the current window
window.moveTo() - move the current window
window.resizeTo() - resize the current window

Screen object:
The screen object provides information about the user's screen or monitor. It is a global object that is 
accessible via the window.screen property. The screen object offers properties that allow developers to 
retrieve various details about the screen's dimensions, color capabilities, and orientation. The values 
are generally reliable across modern browsers. It provide information about the display's color capabilities 
and are useful for determining optimal image rendering and color usage. 

Few Properties of Screen objects are,

screen.width - width of a user's screen
screen.height - height of a user's screen
screen.availWidth - available width of a user's screen
screen.availHeight - available height of a user's screen
screen.colorDepth - color resolution of the user's screen

Document objects:
The document object is the HTML document that appears in the browser window and serves as an interface
for interacting with the web pages content.The browser generates a document object model of a web page 
upon loading it.

The DOM manipulating tool offer methods to access and manipulate the structure and content of a document
such  as getElementById(),querySelector(), createElement() and innerHTML. It represents the entire HTML
document as a node tree, with the document object as the root node. It allow dynamic updates and interactions
with the web page content.

Few Properties of Document objects are,

element.innerHTML - new HTML content or change the inner html of a element
element.attributes - new value or change the attributes value of an element

Few Methods of Document object are,

document.createElement(element) - create a HTML document
ddocument.removeChild(element) - remove a HTML document

In conclusion of the difference between windows, screens and documents object are related and accessible
through the window object, each serves a distinct purpose in client-side JavaScript development, focusing 
on different aspects of the browser environment, screen properties, and HTML document manipulation.
Using these functionalities allows developers to create interactives web experiences.
